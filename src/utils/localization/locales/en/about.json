  "description": "Hello! I'm a developer who loves Capoeira. ðŸ¤­ \nIf you've ever practiced Capoeira, you'll agree that music is one of its most important elements! \nHowever, since most of the songs are in Portuguese, we often end up just mimicking the sounds \nwithout understanding the meaning behind the lyrics. \nBut once I took the time to look up the meanings and sang with understanding, the lyrics stuck in my mind much better, \nand singing became even more enjoyable! Inspired by this experience, \nI created this site to help Capoeira enthusiasts easily find songs and understand their meanings. \nIf there's a song you'd like to add, feel free to let me know anytime. ðŸ«¡ Let's build this together!",
