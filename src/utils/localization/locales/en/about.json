  "description": "Hello! I'm a developer who loves Capoeira. ðŸ¤­\nIf you practice Capoeira, you'll agree that music is one of its essential elements!\nHowever, most of the songs are in Portuguese, so we often end up just mimicking the sounds without understanding the lyrics' meanings.\nBut once I looked up the meanings and sang them, the lyrics stuck in my mind better, and the joy of singing doubled!\nI wanted to share this experience, so I created this site where Capoeira enthusiasts can easily find songs and understand their meanings.\nIf there's a song you'd like to add, please let me know anytime! ðŸ«¡ Let's build this together!\n\nIf you encounter any issues while using the app or have any requests, feel free to let us know. Your feedback will help us improve the service! ðŸ™Œ",
